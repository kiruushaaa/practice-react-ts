# patronum-use-condition

## Why

Use `condition` to branch a flow into then/else targets based on a boolean store or predicate. It keeps branching explicit and avoids multiple `sample` blocks.

## Prefer

```ts
import { condition } from 'patronum';

condition({
  source: submitClicked,
  if: $isValid,
  then: submitFx,
  else: showValidationError,
});
```
